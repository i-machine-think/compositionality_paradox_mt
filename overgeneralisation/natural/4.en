My experience with routers is primarily with Cisco and MikroTik – and my experience with QoS is primarily with Allot ’ s NetEnforcer/NetXplorer systems and MikroTik . The most popular MikroTik devices in my experience ( other than their dedicated long-range wireless devices ) have been their rb750 ( new version named “ hEX “ ) and rb950 - based boards . They have many others available and are relatively inexpensive . In historical comparison with Cisco ’ s premium devices , I ’ ve tended to describe MikroTik ’ s devices as “ 90 % the features at 10 % the cost ” . As this guide is aimed primarily at SME/Home use , inexpensive makes more sense . If you ’ re looking at getting a MikroTik device , note that MikroTik routers do not typically include DSL modems , thus your existing equipment is typically still necessary . Note also that this is not a tutorial on setting up a MikroTik device from scratch . There are plenty of guides available online for that already .
