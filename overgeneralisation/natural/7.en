The firm regarded this practice as an infringement of Article 12 EEC , which pro hibited the Member States from introducing new customs duties or increasing those that they already applied in the common market .

In the final analysis , there is clearly some divergence of interests .

In this case , a Dutch transport firm , Van Gend & Loos , brought an action in a Dutch court against the Dutch customs authorities , who had charged increased customs duties on a chemical product im­ported from the Federal Republic of Ger­many . The firm regarded this practice as an infringement of Article 12 EEC , which pro­hibited the Member States from introducing new customs duties or increasing those that they already applied in the common market . In the final analysis , the outcome of these proceedings depended on the question whether individuals , also , can rely on Article 12 against customs duties levied in breach of the Treaty . As the answer to this question necessitated an interpretation of the EEC Treaty , the Dutch court suspended the pro­ceedings and referred the matter to the Court of Justice . Despite the advice of numerous governments and its Advocate­General , the Court decided that all the rules of the found­ing treaties , which are worded uncondi­ Firstly , the direct applicability of Community law simply means that the latter confers rights and imposes obligations directly not only on the Community institutions and the Member States but also on the Community 's citizens .

I think that that is a very important point , and -although I risk the reproach that in the final analysis the Council has made a declaration which does not match its willingness and determination to achieve zero growth in the 1998 budget - I would say that the Council is sufficiently realistic and reasonable to share Parliament 's view of all the legal obligations of the European Union .
We are therefore totally unable to accept the principle of regulatory committees , in the final analysis because a major aspect of the Commission draft has been disregarded , i.e . to put an end to the proliferation of the various committees , sub-committees , sub-organizations etc . which divide up responsibilities between the Commission and the Council .
The common denominator is , in the final analysis , so small that it does not justify the efforts of the past years .

The activities of the network should , in the final analysis , benefit the citizens ; improving judicial cooperation is merely a half-way objective , the final objective being to create an area of justice for our citizens , which is why the Committee ' s proposed amendments specify that citizens should be able to take recourse to the courts and authorities in any Member State as easily as they can in their own , thereby incorporating in the proposal the objective formulated by the European Council in the Tampere milestones .
I say this because , in the final analysis , Madam President , I have the feeling that if there is an agreement , then the praise for reaching that agreement must essentially go to this Parliament .
Although the report tends to interfere with the labour and social legislation of the Member States , by proposing the regulation of pension funds at European level , not only for the capitals market but also for the social security systems of their beneficiaries , I have in the final analysis supported it , since it expresses the correct options for this field which , incidentally , are being adopted by the Portuguese Government .
However , this is technically not possible , as there is insufficient transmission capacity in the producer 's region.Consequently , a producer who supplies capacity in violation of the agreement , will not receive any payment.In the final analysis , this approach results in a new balance between the available transmission capacity and the capacity supplied by electricity producers .

I would also like to emphasise that , where a regulatory authority uses a bottomup theoretical model in place of the statements of depreciation and interest which the notified operator has to bear in relation to its — largely depreciated and still usable — local network , this will encourage that operator to make a strategic selection of the cost statements to be submitted to the regulatory authority , with the result that , the charges will , in the final analysis , be approved either on the basis of actual costs or on the basis of efficient costs , depending on which figure is higher .
Education and work are important sources of cultural learning which provide people with knowledge and skills enabling them to make a living for themselves and , in the final analysis , to control their own lives .

Another reservation I have about what you said , and to which you perhaps ought to give some thought , is that when you seek to include the criteria for enlargement in the Treaty , like the Commission , you have to bear in mind that you would then subject the enlargement to the Court 's legal control , while this is , in the final analysis , about political decision-making .

Just for the proletariat , just for it and only for it , will it be possible , through the development of its class consciousness become practical in tendency , to overcome that fetter of a still remaining `` immediacy '' or `` abstraction '' which for all purely perceiving behavior , for Hegel 's idealist dialectic as well , clearly remains standing in the final analysis in insuperable `` contradictions . ''
In view of the differences of opinion between the Member States as to the form which a European pass port might take , particularly concerning the use of a set of computerized data , does the Council not think it preferable to abandon a scheme which , in the final analysis , could prejudice the rights and freedoms of the citizens of the Community ?

This is a special date for me , as it was in the final analysis the European Union 's internal market project that sparked debate in Austria , Sweden and Finland as to whether we too ought to join the European Union , and I am very glad that we took this step and can take part in today 's event , which is in part a review .
If the serious attacks on Italian democracy over the years have not been successful in the final analysis , if— as in the case of the massacre at Christmas — the popular response has been immediate and prompt , and if the achievement of major successes in combating the terrorism of the Red Brigades has been possible , it is undoubtedly due to the people 's extraordinary strength and to their commitment to democracy , enabling them to recognize the crazy intentions underlying these criminal acts and causing them to give their backing to the judiciary and police , whose commitment , sometimes at the risk of their lives , has produced these successes .

But what my group believes to be of little benefit and in fact dangerous to the House is to take the backward step of restricting ourselves to this but not retaining the system that assigns to you , Mr President , in the final analysis , responsibility for negotiating this legislative programme with the Commission , in - as is our constant hope - the presence of the Council , so that what we have is a legislative programme agreed with the other Institutions .
In the final analysis , the disadvantages a copyright holder may suffer as a result of conflict between different forms of exploitation derive from the way the associated rights are segmented nationally ; the need for this can not be justified solely by technical imperatives such as different languages , patterns of viewing and listening , the organizational structure of broadcasting companies , etc .
It should not be forgotten that the basis of calculation has changed over the last three or four years , and that the GDP of Member States , at Community level , has increased by 2.5 % .

In the final analysis commodity production is the result of the development of division of labor and of the relative rise of the productive forces resulting from this division of labor .
